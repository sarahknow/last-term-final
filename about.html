  <h2> FAQ's</h2>
  <div class="box-c"> 
		<h6>How can spiritual development make a better athlete?</h6>
<p>Motivation and a competitive nature are required to be an effective athlete; however, basing your identity on your athletic ability alone can leave an athlete competing out of a fear of failure or insecurity. This does not foster a strong team environment, nor does it produce the best athletic achievements. We believe that athletes who are aware of their spiritual identity are secure, and can actually compete at a higher level.</p>

<h6>Do I have to be a varsity athlete to come out to AIA?</h6>
<p>Absolutely not. Our goal is to minister to the athletic communities at UW and WLU, which includes varsity and recreational athletes, coaches, trainers and fans. In fact, you don’t have to be an athlete yourself, as long as you support our goal of helping Christian athletes in their spiritual walks.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-b">
<h6>How often do you meet?</h6>
<p>Meeting frequencies will vary and depend on numbers, but typically we meet once a week. Once a month we plan to have larger events such as a sports games, pizza nights, serving opportunities and so on. In addition to these larger events we have weekly Bible studies that allow us to connect and challenge each other on deeper levels.</p>

<h6>Do I have to be a Christian to come out to AIA?</h6>
<p>Nope! We welcome anyone to join us. If you aren’t a Christian, we encourage you to email us and let him know your situation. We would love the opportunity to share the joy that we have in Christ Jesus. Jesus has changed all of our lives and we wouldn’t be a part of group like this if it wasn’t for Him! Come learn more!</p>

		<img src="images/kevin.jpg" alt="Kevin" class="profile"> 
		<p> Kevin joined staff with AIA in 2008 and is now the campus director for the universities and college in Ottawa. He has a passion for building into young men to help them develop into leaders, husbands and fathers of great character and faith. He loves to see community develop so that athletes can share in authentic relationships as they journey towards a greater understanding of God's plan for their lives. Kevin married his beautiful wife Christine in 2007 and they now have a very active 3 year old son, Eli and a joyful little baby girl, Victoria. Kevin graduated from Western University with a degree in Medical Sciences. His life was forever transformed through AIA and soon after graduation he felt the call to stop pursuing a path to help physically heal others, instead focusing on helping others discover the inner hope and joy that comes through Jesus.</p>

		<img src="images/jessica2.jpg" alt="Jessica" class="profile"> 
		<p> Jessica developed a passion for sport at an early age training as a competitive figure skater in Montreal. Jess first began to search spiritually upon her return home to Ottawa where she remained to finish high school. A strong Christian faith developed and a desire to pursue her passion for integrating faith and sport led Jess to Australia. Jess set off for a Sports Discipleship Training School through Youth With a Mission. While at school, Jess heard a Sports Chaplain speak and there caught the vision for sports ministry. Returning home from Australia, Jess connected with Athletes in Action(AIA) and did a four month summer internship. For the next four years, she lived out of a suitcase and traveled throughout the world with Disney on Ice, 100 Years of Magic touring show as a cast member. During her final summer break from tour, Jess joined an Athletes in Action team to participate in Sports Ministry at the FISU Games in China. Reigniting her passion for integrating faith & sport, Jess completed one more year of tour and then joined full time staff with AIA in Ottawa. She now works on campus at the University of Ottawa, Carleton & Algonquin College helping athletes integrate faith & sport. Jess has a passion for seeing athletes discover God's love, experience His grace & live with a passion to share their faith with others. </p>
